Ideas for stats dashboard

What is the distribution of number of overlays (nodes) per neighborhood?
 * distribution of playing and staked nodes per neighborhood
 * distribution of 'dishonest' nodes per neighborhood

Staking
 * Distribution of staked nodes not playing
 * Distribution of stakes by neighborhood

Other
 * In the last x rounds, what was the average number of revealers by round
 * Skipped rounds distribution over time
 * Distribution of reported depth and are there any seeming anomalies
 * How often are 'honest' nodes misreporting their rc
 * How many rounds are controversial (have some disagreement in hashes)
 * Distribution of freezes over time (how many nodes frozen at any given point)
 * Distribution of freezes over neighborhoods
 * Distribution of anchors


- Read/write communication with online data source

- stakeFrozen needs to be incorporated in data

- Mapping round range slider to calendar time

- For rewards: convert from PLUR to BZZ
